   WASHINGTON--After successfully gaining a majority in both the U.S.
   House and Senate in the 2006 midterm elections, the Democratic Party
   was mired in controversy when the newly elected speaker of the house,
   Rep. Pelosi (D-CA), was caught on camera wearing what appeared to be a
   skirt, ladies top, necklace, and pair of high heels.

   The speaker of the house openly addresses colleagues while wearing
   lipstick and pantyhose.

   Photographs and video showing the speaker traipsing around the House
   floor in the garish attire were leaked to C-SPAN moments after the
   110th Congress took office on Jan. 3. Since that time, Pelosi's
   unconventional clothing choice has been universally decried by
   Washington insiders as "a tragic blot on the long and honorable
   history of U.S. speakers."

   "I was shocked," said Wall Street Journal political analyst Kendra
   Graves. "This is not what I've come to expect from the House of
   Representatives--or the White House or Senate for that matter."

   Although Rep. Pelosi has made no attempts to downplay the scandal, the
   embattled speaker continues to draw controversy as more and more
   Americans have begun to voice their concern over a national
   legislative body being headed by an individual who enjoys wearing
   pantyhose in public.

   "What kind of a message does this send to our children?" Minneapolis
   mother of four Carol Hardwick asked. "That it's 'okay' for our top
   leaders to have long hair and paint their fingernails and speak in a
   high falsetto voice? This is America, for heaven's sake."

   While no formal plans have been issued to remove the speaker from
   office, key members of the Bush administration have publicly expressed
   disappointment with and disapproval of Pelosi's behavior.

   "It's disgusting," said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was
   wearing a three-piece suit and flats at the time.
