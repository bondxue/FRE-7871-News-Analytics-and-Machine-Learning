   LOS ANGELES--With Hollywood starlets facing new troubles this
   year--Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie serving jail time, Lindsay Lohan
   entering rehab, and Britney Spears losing custody of her children due
   to substance abuse and reckless behavior--former Grace Under Fire star
   and pill-popping, chain-smoking, twice-divorced drunk driver Brett
   Butler has become America's de facto sweetheart.

   Butler, a relative pillar of normalcy.

   "Not once in 2007 was Brett Butler arrested, seen exposing her
   genitals in public, or featured drunk and high on the cover of a
   tabloid magazine," celebrity insider Dianne Newton said. "In fact,
   Brett Butler has not been photographed at all since 1999."

   "Thank you, Ms. Butler," Newton added. "Finally, there is someone whom
   young girls can truly look up to as a role model."

   Though Butler has had her share of problems in the past, her
   publicist, Cindy Brenneman, proudly noted that Butler has been sober
   for three years, no longer abuses sleeping pills, and rarely leaves
   her house.

   "Brett is doing relatively great," Brenneman said. "She has shown
   incredible class and integrity recently by not getting wildly
   intoxicated and climbing behind the wheel of a car without a license,
   abusing narcotics to the point that she is putting her own children's
   lives in danger, sobbing uncontrollably on live television about a
   puppy, or killing a man in cold blood, like Home Improvement's
   Patricia Richardson did in July."

   Despite her current state, however, experts predict that the exposure
   Butler will receive from being thrust once again into the national
   spotlight will likely send her spiraling into a drug-fueled depression
   and will be capped by a fatal overdose of painkillers in her Miami
   hotel room early next year.
